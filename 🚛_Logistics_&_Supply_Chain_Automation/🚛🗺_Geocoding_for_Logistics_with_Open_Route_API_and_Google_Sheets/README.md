### How does it work?

This n8n workflow connects to a **Google Sheet** where you store addresses with country codes, and uses the **OpenRouteService API** to calculate:

- 📏 GPS Coordinates (longitude, latitude) 
- 🗺️ Neighbourhood, City and local information

### Steps:
1. ✅ Load addresses with country codes
2. 🔁 Loop through each record  
3. 🚚 Query OpenRouteService 
4. 🧾 Extract and store results: longitude, latitude, neighbourhood
5. 📤 Update the Google Sheet with new values  

### What do I need to get started?

This workflow is beginner-friendly and requires:

- A **Google Sheet** with route pairs (departure and destination coordinates)
- A free **OpenRouteService API key**
