### Context

Hi! I’m Samir — a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

I help logistics teams reduce their environmental footprint by combining **AI automation** and **carbon estimation APIs**.

This workflow is part of our **green logistics initiative**, allowing businesses to **track the CO₂ emissions** of last-mile or regional shipments.

&gt; Automate carbon tracking for shipping operations with n8n!

### Who is this template for?

This workflow is designed for **logistics coordinators**, **transportation planners**, or **sustainability officers** who want to estimate and record emissions for B2B shipments.

Let’s imagine your carrier sends a **shipment confirmation email** after a pickup is scheduled:

![Example Email](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-20.png)

An **AI Agent** reads the email and extracts structured data: **addresses, distance, cargo weight, and delivery time**.

The **Carbon Interface API** is then called to calculate **CO₂ emissions based on weight and distance**, and the results are stored in a **Google Sheet**.

### How does it work?

This workflow automates the process of **tracking CO₂ emissions for scheduled shipments**:

- 📨 Gmail Trigger captures shipment confirmation emails  
- 🧠 AI Agent parses the shipment info (pickup, delivery, weight, distance)  
- 🚚 Carbon Interface API estimates CO₂ emissions  
- 📊 Google Sheets is used to store shipment metadata and carbon results

### Steps:

1. 💌 Trigger on new shipment confirmation email  
2. 🧠 Extract structured shipment info with AI Agent  
3. 📋 Store metadata in Google Sheets  
4. ⚙️ Call Carbon Interface API with weight and distance  
5. 📥 Append estimated CO₂ emissions to the shipment row

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:

- A **Gmail account** to receive shipment confirmation emails  
- A **Google Sheet** to track shipment data and CO₂  
- A free [Carbon Interface API key](https://www.carboninterface.com/docs)  
- OpenAI access for using the AI Agent parser  
- A few sample emails from your logistics provider to test
