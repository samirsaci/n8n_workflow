### Context
Hey! I'm Samir, a **Supply Chain Data Scientist from Paris** who spent six years in China studying and working while **struggling to learn Mandarin.**

![I want to study Mandarin (In Mandarin)](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-23.png)

I know the challenges of **mastering a complex language** like Chinese and my greatest support was **flash cards**. Therefore,  I designed this workflow to support fellow Mandarin learners by **automating flashcard creation** using n8n, so they can focus more on learning and less on manual data entry.

### Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for **language learners** and **educators** who want to automate the creation of flashcards for Mandarin (or any other language) using **Google Translate API**, an **AI agent** for phonetic transcription and generating an illustrative sentence and a **free image retrieval API**.

#### Why?
If you use the open-source application **Anki**, this workflow will help you automatically generate personalized study materials.

#### How?
Let us imagine you want to learn how to say the word **Contract** in Mandarin.

The workflow will automatically
1. **Translate the word** in Simplified Mandarin *(Mandarin: 合同)*.
2. Provide the **phonetic transcription** *(Pinyin: Hétóng)* 
3. Generate **an example sentence** *(Example: 我们签订了一份合同.)*
4. Download an **illustrative picture** (For example, a picture of a contract signature)

![Example of Google Sheet](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/image-1.png)

All these fields are automatically recorded in a Google Sheet, making it easy to import into Anki and generate flashcards instantly
