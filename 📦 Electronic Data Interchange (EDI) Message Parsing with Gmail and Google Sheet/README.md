### What is an EDI Message?
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is **a standardized method** of automatically transferring data between computer systems.

![Data Exchange between Systems](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-20.png)

They ensure the **smooth flow of essential transactional data**, such as **purchase orders**, invoices, **shipping notices**, and more.

![Example of Order Translated in EDI](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/image-21.png)

For instance, a manufacturing company can receive purchase orders from a retailer via EDI.

However, they need **complex integration** for the transmission and processing of the messages.

### Who is this template for?
This workflow template is designed for **small companies** that cannot connect to their customers and need to **manually process** the EDI messages received.

### How does it work?
This workflow uses a **Gmail Trigger** that analyzes all the incoming emails.
1. **📧 Gmail Trigger** → Detects emails with "EDI" in the subject.
2. **📜 Parses EDI Message** → Uses a JavaScript Code Node to extract structured data.
3. **📊 Formats the Data** → Converts it into a table-friendly format.
4. **📑 Updates Google Sheets** → Automatically logs the processed orders.

### Prerequisite
This workflow does not require any additional paying subscription.

- A **Google Drive Account** with a folder including a Google Sheet
- API Credentials: **Google Drive API**, **Google Sheets API** and **Gmail API**
- A Google sheet to store the shipment records. *You do not need to prepare the columns.*
