### How does it work?

This n8n workflow connects to a **Google Sheet** where you store city-to-city shipment lanes, and uses the **OpenRouteService API** to calculate:

- 📏 Distance (in meters)  
- ⏱️ Travel time (in seconds)  
- 🪪 Number of route steps  

### Steps:
1. ✅ Load departure/destination city coordinates from a Google Sheet  
2. 🔁 Loop through each record  
3. 🚚 Query OpenRouteService using the **truck (driving-hgv)** profile  
4. 🧾 Extract and store results: distance, duration, number of steps  
5. 📤 Update the Google Sheet with new values  

### What do I need to get started?

This workflow is beginner-friendly and requires:

- A **Google Sheet** with route pairs (departure and destination coordinates)
- A free **OpenRouteService API key**
