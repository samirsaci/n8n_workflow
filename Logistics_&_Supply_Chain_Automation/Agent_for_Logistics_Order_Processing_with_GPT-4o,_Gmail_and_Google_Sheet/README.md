### Context

Hey! I’m Samir, a Supply Chain Data Scientist from Paris, and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

We design tools to help companies improve their **logistics processes** using data analytics, AI, and automation—to **reduce costs and minimize environmental impacts**.

&gt;Let’s use N8N to improve logistics operations!

### Who is this template for?

This workflow template is designed for **logistics or manufacturing operations** that receive orders by email.

![Example of emails](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/03/image-17.png) 

The example above illustrate the challenge we want to tackle using an **AI Agent** to parse the information and load them in a **Google sheet**.

If you want to understand how I built this workflow, check my detailed tutorial:

### How does it work?

The workflow is connected to a **Gmail Trigger** to open all the emails that include *Inbound Order* in their subject.

The email is parsed by an **AI Agent** equipped with **OpenAI's GPT** to collect all the information.

The results are pulled in a **Google Sheet**.

These orderlines can then be **transferred to warehouse teams** to prepare ***order receiving**.

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:
- **Gmail and Google Drive Accounts** with the API credentials to access it via n8n
- An **OpenAI API key** (GPT-4o) for the chat model.
- A **Google Sheet** with these columns: **PO_NUMBER, EXPECTED_DELIVERY DATE, SKU_ID, QUANTITY**

### Next Steps

Follow the sticky notes in the workflow to configure each node and start using **AI to support your logistic operations**.
