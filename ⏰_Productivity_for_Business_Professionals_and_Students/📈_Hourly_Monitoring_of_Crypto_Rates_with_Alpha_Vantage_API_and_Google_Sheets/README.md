### Context

Hi! I’m Samir — a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

I help companies automate data pipelines using **APIs**, **AI agents**, and **workflow automation** to improve operational visibility and decision-making.

This workflow is part of our **financial monitoring toolkit**, allowing businesses to **track real-time cryptocurrency exchange rates** for assets like BTC and ETH.

&gt; Monitor crypto rates in real time and log the data to Google Sheets.

### Who is this template for?

This workflow is designed for **crypto analysts**, **finance teams**, or **automation enthusiasts** who want to collect and track crypto exchange rates automatically for reporting or analysis.

Let’s imagine you want to monitor BTC and ETH prices against the EUR:

![Example Output](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/06/image-26.png)

The **Alpha Vantage API** is called every hour to collect the exchange rate, bid/ask prices, and timestamp.

This data is saved in **Google Sheets** and can trigger a **Telegram alert**.

### How does it work?

This workflow automates the hourly logging of crypto exchange rates:

- ⏰ Schedule Trigger launches the workflow every hour
- 🌐 Alpha Vantage API fetches BTC and ETH exchange rates (to EUR)
- 📄 Google Sheets node appends each result to a tab (BTC or ETH)
- 📲 Telegram node sends a summary alert with the latest rate info

### Steps:

1. ⏰ Trigger every hour via Schedule node
2. 🌐 Call Alpha Vantage API for BTC and ETH
3. 📊 Append rates, bid/ask prices, and timestamp to Google Sheets
4. 📲 Send a formatted Telegram message with rate summary
