### Context

Hi! I’m Samir — a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

This workflow is part of my latest project: an **AI assistant that automatically analyses n8n workflow executions, detects failures, and identifies root causes** through natural conversation with Claude Desktop.

![Concept](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/image-2.png)

&gt; Turn your automation logs into intelligent conversations with an AI that understands your workflows.

The idea is to use _Claude Desktop_ to help monitor and debug your workflows deployed in production.

The workflow shared here is part of the setup.

### Who is this template for?

This template is designed for **automation engineers**, **data professionals**, and **AI enthusiasts** who manage multiple workflows in **n8n** and want a smarter way to track errors or performance without manually browsing execution logs.

If you’ve ever discovered a failed workflow hours after it happened — this is for you.

### What does this workflow do?

This workflow acts as the **bridge** between your n8n instance and the **Claude MCP Server**.

![Principle](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-1.png)

It exposes three main routes that can be triggered via a webhook:

1. `get_active_workflows` → Fetches all currently active workflows
2. `get_workflow_executions` → Retrieves the latest executions and calculates health KPIs
3. `get_execution_details` → Extracts detailed information about failed executions for debugging

Each request is automatically routed and processed, providing Claude with structured execution data for real-time analysis.

### How does it fit in the overall setup?

Here’s the complete architecture:

```
Claude Desktop ←→
   MCP Server ←→
      n8n Monitor Webhook ←→
         n8n API
```

- The **MCP Server** (Python-based) communicates with your n8n instance through this workflow.
- The **Claude Desktop app** can then query workflow health, execution logs, and error patterns using natural language.
- The **n8n workflow** aggregates, cleans, and returns the relevant metrics (failures, success rates, timing, alerts).

📘 The full concept and architecture are explained in my article published on my blog:

### 🎥 Tutorial

The full setup tutorial (with source code and demo) is available on YouTube:

[![Tutorial + Demo](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/11/temp-8.png)](https://youtu.be/oJzNnHIusZs)

### How does it work?

- 🌐 Webhook Trigger receives the MCP server requests
- 🔀 Switch node routes actions based on `"action"` parameter
- ⚙️ HTTP Request nodes fetch execution and workflow data via the n8n API
- 🧮 A Code node calculates KPIs (success/failure rates, timing, alerts)
- 📤 The processed results are returned as JSON for Claude to interpret

### Example use cases

Once connected, you can ask Claude questions like:

- “Show me all workflows that failed in the last 25 executions.”
- “Why is my `Bangkok Meetup Scraper` workflow failing?”
- “Give me a health report of my n8n instance.”

![Example](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-3.png)

Claude will reply with structured insights, including failure patterns, node diagnostics, and health status indicators (🟢🟡🔴).

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:

- A **self-hosted n8n instance**
- **Claude Desktop** app installed
- The **MCP server source code** (available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/samirsaci/mcp-n8n-monitor))
- The **webhook URL** from this workflow is configured in your `.env` file

Follow the tutorial for more details, don't hesitate to leave your questions in the comment section.

### Next Steps

🗒️ Use the sticky notes inside the workflow to:

- Replace `&lt;YOUR_N8N_INSTANCE&gt;` with your own URL
- Test the webhook routes individually using the “Execute Workflow” button
- Connect the MCP server and Claude Desktop to start monitoring
