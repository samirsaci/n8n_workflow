### Context

Hey! I’m Samir, a Supply Chain Engineer and Data Scientist from Paris, and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

In my personal blog, I share insights on how to use **AI, automation, and data analytics** to improve logistics, operations, and digital sustainability practices.

&gt; Have you heard about accessibility?

In this workflow, I use n8n to improve the quality of alternative texts for images **on my personal website.**

### Who is this template for?

This workflow is for:
- **Bloggers** and **website owners** who want to **improve accessibility**
- **SEO professionals** looking to boost page performance
- **Web developers** and **product teams** automating web audits


### What does it do?

This n8n workflow:
1. 🔍 Downloads the HTML of a blog or web page  
2. 🖼️ Extracts all `<img>` tags and their `alt` attributes  
3. 📉 Detects missing or too-short alt texts  
4. 🤖 Sends those images to **GPT-4o (with vision)** to generate new alt descriptions  
5. 📄 Saves the results into a **Google Sheet**, updating the alt text when needed  


### How it works

![Audit Workflow](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/image-7.png)

1. **Set a page URL** using the `Set` node  
2. **Download HTML** content  
3. **Extract image `src` and `alt`** using a `Code` node  
4. **Store results** in a Google Sheet  
5. **Filter images** with `altLength &lt; 50`  
6. **Send image URL** to GPT-4o 
7. **Update the Google Sheet** with the newly generated `newAlt` text

The AI alt texts are concise, descriptive, and accessibility-compliant.

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:
- A **Google Sheet** to store the audit results
- An **OpenAI account with GPT-4o access**

### Notes

- GPT-generated alt texts are limited to ~125–150 characters for best results
- Use this to comply with **WCAG** and improve Google indexing
- Easily adapt it to audit multiple domains or e-commerce catalogues
