### Who is this template for?

This workflow template is designed for **logistics operations** that need a monitoring solution for their **distribution chains**.

Connected to your Transportation Management Systems, this AI agent can answer any question about the shipments handled by your distribution teams.

### How does it work?

The workflow is connected to a **Google BigQuery** table that stores **outbound order data** (customer deliveries).

Here’s what the AI agent does:
1. 🤔 Receives a user question via chat.  
2. 🧠 Understands the request and **generates the correct SQL query**.  
3. ✅ Executes the SQL query using a **BigQuery** node.  
4. 💬 Responds to the user in **plain English**.

![Example of Interactions](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/Chat-Screen.png)

Thanks to the chat memory, users can ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into the data.

### What do I need to get started?

This workflow requires **no advanced programming skills**.

You’ll need:
- A **Google BigQuery account** with an SQL table storing transactional records.
- An **OpenAI API key** (GPT-4o) for the chat model.

### Next Steps

Follow the sticky notes in the workflow to configure each node and start using **AI to support your supply chain operations**.
