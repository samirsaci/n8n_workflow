### Context

Hi! I’m Samir — Supply Chain Engineer, Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).

&gt; Let's use AI with n8n to help SMEs digitalise their logistics operations!

Traditional inventory cycle counts often require clipboards, scanners, and manual reconciliation.  

With this workflow, the operator walks through the warehouse, sends **voice messages**, and the bot automatically updates the inventory records.

Using AI-based transcription and structured extraction, we optimise the entire process with a simple mobile device connected to Telegram.

### Demo of the workflow

In this example, the bot guides the operator through the cycle count for three locations.

The workflow automatically records the results in Google Sheets.

### Who is this template for?

This template is ideal for companies with limited IT resources:
 
- **Inventory controllers** who need a hands-free, mobile-friendly counting process 
- Small **3PLs** and retailers looking to digitalise stock control

### What does this workflow do?

This automation uses Telegram and OpenAI’s Whisper transcription: 

1. The operator sends **/start** to the bot. 
2. The bot identifies the **first location** that still needs to be counted.  
3. The operator is guided to the location through a Telegram message.  
4. The operator records a **voice message** with the `location ID` and the `number of units` counted.
5. AI nodes transcribe the audio and extract `location_id` and `quantity`.  
6. If the message cannot be transcribed, the bot asks the operator to repeat.  
7. If the location is valid and still pending, the Google Sheet is updated.  
8. The bot sends the **next location**, until the final one is completed.  
9. The operator receives a confirmation that the cycle count is finished.

### Next Steps

Before running the workflow, follow the sticky notes and configure:

- Connect your **Telegram Bot API**  
- Add your **OpenAI API Key** to the transcription and extraction nodes  
- Connect your **Google Sheets credentials**  
- Update the Google Sheet ID and the worksheet name in all Spreadsheet nodes  
- Adjust the AI prompts depending on your warehouse location naming conventions
