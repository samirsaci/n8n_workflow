### Context

Hi! I'm [Samir](https://samirsaci.com/about), Supply Chain Engineer, Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).

&gt; Let's use AI with n8n to automate supply chain performance tracking!

Tracking **On-Time In-Full (OTIF)** delivery performance is critical for retail logistics, but manually compiling data, computing KPIs, and writing analysis reports is time-consuming and error-prone.

This workflow automates the entire process: collecting shipment data, aggregating weekly KPIs, generating AI powered performance analyses, and pushing everything into a Notion dashboard.

### Demo of the workflow

The workflow collects shipment records from your TMS and WMS, then aggregates them by week.

An AI Agent analyses each week's performance and generates summary cards in Notion.

Weekly OTIF data is automatically pushed to a Notion database for tracking and visualisation.

### Who is this template for?

This template is ideal for logistics and supply chain teams looking to automate KPI reporting:

- **Supply chain managers** tracking delivery performance across carriers and warehouses
- **Logistics analysts** who need automated weekly OTIF scorecards
- **Operations teams** looking to leverage AI for performance insights

### Tutorial

A complete tutorial (with explanations of every node) is available on YouTube:

### What does this workflow do?

This automation uses Notion databases and OpenAI AI Agents to build a complete OTIF scorecard:

1. The workflow is triggered manually (or on a schedule).
2. Shipment data is collected from your TMS and WMS systems.
3. Records are **aggregated by week**, computing On-Time rate, In-Full rate, and OTIF rate.
4. An **AI Agent** analyses each week's performance and identifies trends, issues, and recommendations.
5. Weekly KPI rows are pushed to the **Daily OTIF Summary** database in Notion.
6. Per-week **AI analysis cards** are created in the **AI Generated Analysis** database.
7. A second **AI Agent** generates a **global performance summary** across all weeks.
8. The global summary card is updated in Notion with the overall analysis.

### Next Steps

Before running the workflow, follow the sticky notes and configure:

- Connect your **Notion API credentials** and update the database IDs in all Notion nodes
- Add your **OpenAI API Key** to the AI Agent nodes
- Update the **"Collect Shipments from TMS & WMS"** node with your actual data source (API, Google Sheets, or database)
- Adjust the AI prompts to match your specific KPI thresholds and business context
- Set up the **Notion template** with the two required databases: "Daily OTIF Summary" and "AI Generated Analysis"
- Duplicate the **[Notion template](https://seed-steed-3b7.notion.site/OTIF-Scorecard-for-Retail-Logistics-31b81c23345c81f480b4cde0cf488060?pvs=74)** to your workspace before connecting the workflow
- (Optional) Change the trigger from manual to a **scheduled cron** for automated weekly reporting
