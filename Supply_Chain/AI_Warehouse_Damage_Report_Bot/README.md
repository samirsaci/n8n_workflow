### Context

Hi! I’m Samir — Supply Chain Engineer, Data Scientist based in Paris, and founder of [LogiGreen](https://logi-green.com).

&gt; Let us use n8n to help small companies digitalise their logistics and supply chain!

This workflow helps warehouse operators generate a complete damage report without needing to write anything manually.

![Workflow Overview](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-26.png)

In warehouse operations, damaged pallets must be reported quickly and consistently. 
 
You can automate the entire process using **AI to analyse photos of the damages**.

### Example of damage report

The process starts with instructions sent with the operator:

A photo of the damaged pallets is shared with the bot:

A complete report is generated and sent by email:

### Who is this template for?

This template is ideal for companies with limited IT ressources:

- **Warehouse operators** who need a fast reporting tool  
- **Quality teams** who want consistent and structured reports  
- **3PLs and logistics providers** looking to digitalise damage claims  
- **Manufacturers and retailers** with high inbound pallet volumes  
- **Anyone using Telegram** on the warehouse floor for quick interactions

### What does this workflow do?

This workflow acts as an **AI-powered damaged goods reporting assistant** using Telegram, OpenAI Vision and Gmail.

1. A operator sends a picture of the damaged pallet via **Telegram**.  
2. The workflow downloads the image and sends it to **GPT-4o** for damage analysis.  
3. The bot replies and asks for a **photo of the pallet barcode**.  
4. The barcode picture is processed by **GPT-4o Mini** to extract the pallet number.  
5. The workflow combines both results (damage analysis + pallet ID).  
6. It generates an **HTML email report** with: damage summary, observed issues, severity level and recommended actions   
7. The report is automatically sent via **Gmail** to the configured recipient.  
8. The operator receives a confirmation message in Telegram.

The process does not require any data input from the operator, only to take pictures!


### Next Steps

Before running the workflow, follow the sticky notes and configure:

- Connect your **Telegram Bot API**  
- Add your **OpenAI API Key** in the AI nodes  
- Connect your **Gmail** credentials  
- Update the **recipient email** in the “Send Report by Email” node
