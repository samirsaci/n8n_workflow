### Context

Hey! I’m Samir, a Data Scientist from Paris and the founder of [LogiGreen Consulting](https://logi-green.com).

We use **AI, automation, and data** to support sustainable business practices for small, medium and large companies.

I implemented this workflow to support an event agency to automate **image processing like background removal** using Photoroom API.

&gt; Automate your photos processing with n8n!

This n8n workflow collects all images in a **Google Drive** folder shared with multiple photographers.

For each image, it calls the **Photoroom API**:
- A processed image w/o a background is saved in a subfolder **Remove Background**
- The original pictures are saved in the subfolder **Original**

This workflow, triggered every morning, will **process the backlog of images**.

### Who is this template for?

This workflow is useful for:
- **Digital Marketing** teams that use images for content creation
- **Photographs** or **Event Organisers** that collect large amounts of photos that need processing
  

### What does it do?

This n8n workflow:
1. ⏰ Triggers automatically every morning  
2. 🖼️ Collects the names and IDs of all images in the folder
3. 🧹 HTTP POST request to Photoroom API to remove the background
4. 📄 Stores the processed image and the original image in two separate sub-folders

### What do I need to get started?

You’ll need:
- A **Google Drive Account** connected to your n8n instance with credentials
